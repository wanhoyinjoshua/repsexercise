        TASK is a post stroke exercise that is guided bby video
        <br></br>
        This program involves the practice of four everyday tasks:
        <br></br>
        <ul>
            <li>Sitting</li>
            <li>Standing</li>
            <li>Stepping</li>
            <li>Standing up</li>
        </ul>
       
        <br></br>
        TASK was developed by a team of physiotherapists at Macquarie University, led by Dr Kate Scrivener.
        <br></br>
        It was designed to improve and/or maintain strength and mobility, as well as encouraging people after stroke to be more physically active.
        <br></br>
        The aim of TASK is to assist people after stroke to exercise at home, on an ongoing basis.

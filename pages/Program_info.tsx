            <br></br>
            Welcome to the REPS app!
            REPS consists of two post stroke exercise programs TASK and PUSH.
            <br></br>
            Both programs utilise a stragety that can assist recovery after stroke - repetitive exercise.
            TASK involves the repetitive practice of four everyday tasks whereas PUSH involves the repetitive practice of arm movements.
